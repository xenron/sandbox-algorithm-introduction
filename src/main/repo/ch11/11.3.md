### Exercises 11.3-1
***
Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key?

### `Answer`
首先计算出给定关键字的hash值. 对列表中的每个元素,先验证hash值对不对,再进行字符串的比较.


### Exercises 11.3-2
***
Suppose that a string of r characters is hashed into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. The number m is easily represented as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself?

### `Answer`
One easy approach would adding the values of each character to get a sum and then take a modulo 128. Another way would be using n-degree equation with each character value acting as a co-efficient for the nth term.
Example: S[0] * x^n + S[1] * x^(n-1)+ …. + S[n-1], for better result substitute x = 33 or 37 or 39. This is the famous Horner’s method for finding a hash value.

### Exercises 11.3-3
***
Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2p - 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2p. Show that if string x can be derived from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.

### `Answer`
有一个很简单的数论知识.先举个例子

3 * 128^3 mod 127 = 3 * 128^2 * (128 mod 127) mod 127 = 3 * 128^2 mod 127 = 3 mod 127 = 3

无论怎么交换字符串的order,radix的影响都会消失. 因为2p^n mod 2p-1 === 1.

### `Answer`
 key | value

 62 | 318
 63 | 936
 64 | 554
 65 | 172

Define a family 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\mathscr{H} )
 of hash functions from a finite set U to a finite set B to be **ϵ-universal** if for all pairs of distinct elements k and l in U,
 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\Pr\\{h\(k\) = h\(l\)\\} \\le \\epsilon)

where the probability is over the choice of the hash function **h** drawn at random from the family ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\mathscr{H} ). Show that an ϵ-universal family of hash functions must have

### Exercises 11.3-6
***
Let U be the set of n-tuples of values drawn from Zp, and let B = Zp, where p is prime. Definethe hash function hb : U → B for b in Zp on an input n-tuple [a0, a1, ..., an-1] from U as

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_b\(\\langle a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1} \\rangle\) =
