### Exercises 25.2-1
***
Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the weighted, directed graph of Figure 25.2. Show the matrix D(k) that results for each iteration of the outer loop.
### `Answer`

straightforward.


### Exercises 25.2-2
***
Show how to compute the transitive closure using the technique of Section 25.1.
### `Answer`
将EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS中第7行的min换成**OR**,+换成**AND**

### Exercises 25.2-3
***
Modify the FLOYD-WARSHALL procedure to include computation of the Π(k) matrices according to equations (25.6) and (25.7). Prove rigorously that for all i ∈ V , the predecessor subgraph Gπ,i is a shortest-paths tree with root i.
### `Answer`
UNSOLVED
				

### Exercises 25.2-4
***
As it appears above, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm requires Θ(n3) space, since we compute for i, j, k = 1, 2,...,n. Show that the following procedure, which simply drops all the superscripts, is correct, and thus only Θ(n2) space is required.![](./repo/s2/1.png)

### `Answer`
当然是正确的,因为这个动态规划只需要保存上一个状态.也就是要计算当前这个状态只需要借助上一个状态.

### Exercises 25.2-5
***
Suppose that we modify the way in which equality is handled in equation (25.7):![](./repo/s2/2.png)
Is this alternative definition of the predecessor matrix Π correct?

### `Answer`
感觉正确呀.

### Exercises 25.2-6
***
How can the output of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm be used to detect the presence of a negative-weight cycle?

### `Answer`
只需要在正常的Floyd-Warshall算法完成后再多跑一个循环,如果有一个值还能更新则说明有负权回路.

### Exercises 25.2-7
***
Another way to reconstruct shortest paths in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses values ￼Φij(k) fori, j, k = 1, 2,..., n, where ￼￼Φij(k) is the highest-numbered intermediate vertex of a shortest path from i to j in which all intermediate vertices are in the set {1, 2,..., k}. Give a recursive formulation for ￼ ￼Φij(k) , modify the FLOYD-WARSHALL procedure to compute the ￼Φij(k) values, and rewrite the PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH procedure to take the matrix Φ = (￼Φij(n)) as an input. How is the matrix Θ like the s table in the matrix-chain multiplication problem of Section 15.2?

### `Answer`

				Φij(k－1)   如果dij(k-1) <= dik(k-1) + dkj(k-1) 
	Φij(k) ＝ 
				k			otherwise
				

	PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH(Φ,i,j)
		if i == j
			then print i
		else if Φ(i,j) = -1
			then print "no path from 'i' to 'j' exists"
		else
			PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH(Φ,i,Φ(i, j))
			print Φ(i, j)
			PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH(Φ,Φ(i, j),j)

### Exercises 25.2-8
***
Give an O(V E)-time algorithm for computing the transitive closure of a directed graph G =(V, E).

### `Answer`
对每个节点都跑一次DFS. 一共V个点,E条边，所以是O(VE)的时间.

### Exercises 25.2-9
***
Suppose that the transitive closure of a directed acyclic graph can be computed in f(|V|,|E|) time, where f is a monotonically increasing function of |V| and |E|. Show that the time to compute the transitive closure G* = (V, E*) of a general directed graph G = (V, E) is f(|V|,|E|) + O(V + E*).
